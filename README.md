# Discord Weather Bot

A basic bot that reports the weather

## Information

This project was to practice making bots, including Discord bots, and my first real project in Python. Uses [openweatherapi](https://openweathermap.org/).<br>

Because this application runs on the *free* subscription of the openweatherapi, it currently only supports. If you would like to see more implemented in the future, consider [donating](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Kirbout).
